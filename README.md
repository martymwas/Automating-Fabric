This notebook demonstrates how to use Microsoft Fabric Semantic Link and Semantic Lab to explore, validate, and enrich data from a semantic model.
It connects directly to a Fabric semantic model ( Production & Sales Data Model or SalesSample) and showcases:

Listing datasets, tables, and measures

Evaluating measures and running DAX

Enriching custom data with semantic model KPIs

Validating data quality with functional dependencies

Discovering and visualizing relationships

Checking for relationship violations


**Notebook Sections**

Setup – Import libraries, connect to semantic model

Explore Models – List datasets, tables, measures

Evaluate Measures – Slice KPIs by dimensions

DAX Queries – Run custom DAX from Python

Augment Data – Add semantic measures to local datasets

Semantic Lab – Data Quality – Validate dependencies (e.g., ProductID → ProductName)

Semantic Lab – Relationships – Visualize schema and check relationship violations
